2. storage: where computers store this input
3. processing: take the information from storage and process it and send it to storge again.

## computer works on 01 language.
0 = NO , False and off
1 = Yes , True , on
 this is called the binary number system

# ALL THING CAN BE RE-PRESENTED IN NUMBERS

## computer circuit
1. a simple circuit takes an electric signal and flips it

2. but complicated circuits take multiple signals & combine them to give different results
3. logic gates: and, not , or , nand , nor and xor
 # why is todays circuits are microscopic in size and way faster ?
  because the smaller circuit is the less distance the electrical signal has to go, its the speed of light

# how computers work hardware & software ?
 hardware : what is inside, you can see it as plugs, circuits , chips ...etc.
 software: you don't see it is computer programs, codes running on the machine

 CPU: master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer 

# operating system 
 the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer like windos , mac , android ...etc.
