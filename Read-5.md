## This book explains how JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive,interesting, and user-friendly. 
## what is expected after read the book?
1. Understanding some basic programming concepts
2. Learning the language itself, you
need to know its vocabulary
and how to structure your sentences.
3. Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at java script exampels.

## WHAT THE ONLY ONE EQUIPMENT YOU NEED?

## What does the scripts means?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

## How can I write a script?
To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.

# then break that down into smaller steps like : 
1. Define the goals 
2. design the scripts

# RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES
 ## 6 RULES:
1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.
2. The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.
3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. 
4. All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names,
5. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores.
6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.

# ARRAYS 
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
## where we should we use ARRAYS?
You should consider using an
array whenever you are working
with a list or a set of values that
are related to each other.

# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
