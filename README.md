## **GROWTH MINDSET**
### SMALL SUMMARY 

*GROWTH MINDSET* 
It can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting
of higher goals and more achievement.


### *there is a difference between fixed mindset, and growth mindset:* 
one of it is when the fixed mindset's person faced with challenges he avoids its but the other person 
who has a growth mind set he embraces the challenges and keep going.

**and right now I advise myself**
1. try to have a growth mindset.
2. be positive and ask myself what was the best part of the day?
3. the true phrase “no pain, no gain” is pure growth mindset.
