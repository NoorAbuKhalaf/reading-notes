# IMAGES 
## controlling sizes of images in CSS
You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

# Aligning images
In the last chapter, you saw how the float property can be used to move an element to the left or the right of its containing block allowing text to flow around it.

## background image 
The background-image property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

## background position
When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background
image should be placed.

## CSS3: gradiants background image 
CSS3 is going to introduce the ability to specify a gradient for the background of a box. The gradient is created using the background-image property and, at the time of writing, different browsers required a different syntax.

## Contrast of background images
If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.

# Video and Audio 
The (video) and (audio) elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages

## Exploring the CSS
We start off with the visibility of the custom controls set to hidden. In our JavaScript later on, we will set the controls to visible, and remove the controls attribute from the video element. This is so that, if the JavaScript doesn't load for some reason, users can still use the video with the native controls.
