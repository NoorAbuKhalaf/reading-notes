## lists

There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:
1. Ordered lists: The ordered list is created with the *ol* element.
2. Unordered lists:The unordered list is created with the *ul* element.
3. Definition lists: The definition list is created with the *dl* element, *dt* and *dd*
4. nested lisits: You can put a second list inside an *li* element to create a sublist or nested list.

## Notes:
1.There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.
2. Ordered lists use numbers. 
3. Unordered lists use bullets. 
4. Definition lists are used to define terminology. 
5. Lists can be nested inside one another.

# Boxes
## You can set several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes. 

1. By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. Tob set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.

2. Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

## Overflowing Content
The overflow property tells the
browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger
than the box itself. It can have
one of two values: hidden ,scroll

# using if / else statements 
 Here you can see that an if ... e 1 se statement al lows you
to provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition evaluates to true 
2. another set if the condition is
false
# JavaScript
## SWITCH STATEMENTS
A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value.
