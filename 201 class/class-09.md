provides tools to show you the CSS styles that
apply to an element when you hover over it,
along with the structure of the HTML.

# notes:
1. Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.

2. Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
3.Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.
