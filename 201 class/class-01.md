# introduction 
this book, It has been written with two very different types of people in mind:

1. Those who want to learn how to design and build websites from scratch
2. Anyone who has a website and wants more control over the appearance of their pages

this book has:
1. introduction 
2. referance pages
3. background pages
4. diagram
5. example pages
6. summary pages

## Is it hard to Learn?
To make it easier for you to learn, we threw away the traditional template used by publishers and redesigned
this book from scratch.
 
## In order to teach you about creating web pages, this book is divided into three sections:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Practical 

## consider the different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminology.

1. Browsers
2. Web Servers
3. Screen readers

## How Websites Are Created
All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platformsoften add a few more technologies into the mix.
## How the Web Works
When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

# Structure
**_So, what is the structure?_**

## Attributes Tell Us More About Elements
Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

1. Attributes require a name and a value.
2. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
3. Opening tags can carry attributes which tell us more about the content of that element.

# EXTRA MARKUP
## **_we use HTML 5_**

Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the
page even if it is not included).

1. Comments in HTML: If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser,

2. ID Attribute: Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.

3. Class Attribute: Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document

4. Block Elements: Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are known as block level elements.

5. Inline Elements: Some elements will always appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements.

6. Grouping Text & Elements In a Block: by using div 
7. Grouping Text & Elements Inline: 
by using span
8. IFrames: An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your
page — and in that window you
can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline
frame.
9. Information About Your Pages: by using meta

# HTML5 LAYOUT
## **_Headers & Footers_**
● The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.

● A header or footer for an individual article or section within the page.

## **_Navigation_**
## **_Articels_**
## **_Aside_**
## **_Sections_**

1. Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

2. o make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

# Process & Design
1. It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

2. Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

3. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

4. Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helpsvisitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

5. You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

6. You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

# JAVA SCRIPT
## introduction
This book explains how JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about
jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.

## what is expected after read the book?
1. Understanding some basic programming concepts
2. Learning the language itself, you
need to know its vocabulary
and how to structure your sentences.
3. Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at java script exampels.

## WHAT THE ONLY ONE EQUIPMENT YOU NEED?
to use this book are a computer with a modern web browser installed, and your favorite code editor, (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit. Sublime Text. or Coda).

## WHAT is JAVA Script can do ?
1. ACCESS CONTENT
2. MODIFY CONTENT
3. PROGRAM RULES
4. REACT TO EVENTS

## EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER
the applications of JAVA Script on the browser will be like:
1. Slideshows
2. Forms
3. Reload part of page
4. filtering data

## the ABC of programming 
 what is a script and how do I creat one?

 1. A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
 2. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
 3. Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
4. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
