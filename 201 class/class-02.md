# Introducing CSS
## how to make your web pages more attractive, controlling the design of them using CSS.
CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.

CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
1. Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
2. Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
3. CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
