# layout
we are going to look at how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts.
1. Building Blocks:
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box. Block-level boxes start on a new line

2. Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

3. Controlling the Position of Elements
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning.

## Screen Sizes
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

## Screen Resolution
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

## Fixed Width Layouts
Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.

## Liquid Layouts
Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.

# Layout Grids
Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.

# Notes:
1. <div> elements are often used as containingelements to group together sections of a page.
2. Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
3. CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
4. You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
