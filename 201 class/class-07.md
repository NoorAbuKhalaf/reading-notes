# Domain Modeling
## is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.

# Define a constructor and initialize properties
To define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function. Below is a table that summarizes a JavaScript representation of an EpicFailVideo object.
# what is the object-oriented programming
[object-orianted](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)
## in object-orineted programming you can:
1. Define a constructor and initialize properties
2. Generate random numbers
3. Calculate daily Likes
4. Calculate weekly Likes

Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
6. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

# how to creat table:
There are several types of information
that need to be displayed in a grid or
table. For example: sports results, stock
reports, train timetables.
